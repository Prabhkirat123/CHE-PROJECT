      <td>  <h1>Proposed methods for air pollution control:</h1>
      <h2>Source Correction Methods:</h2> <p style ="width: 75%;height:auto">Formation of pollutants can be reduced at the source itself. Those methods which have minimum air pollution potential can be selected for this

        Substitution of raw materials:<ul> <li>If the use of a raw material is creating pollutants, alternative raw materials can be sought. For eg Natural gas can substitute traditional high contaminant coal.</li>
       <li> Process modifications: Bringing changes in the processes in order to reduce the pollutant quantity. For eg. If air intake of boiler furnace is adjusted then excess fly ash emissions at power plants can be reduced.</li>
        <li>Modification of existing equipment: Improvements in the design of machinery can reduce the quantity of the pollutants released. For eg. If open hearth furnaces are replaced with controlled basic oxygen furnaces or electric furnaces, smoke carbon monoxide and fumes can be reduced to a great extent.</li>
        <li>Maintenance of equipment: much pollution is caused due to the poor maintenance of the equipment. There can be leakages and these can be reduced by routine checks of ducts, pipes, valves, pumps, seals and gaskets.</li>
        <li>Pollution control equipment: These are used to filter out particulate and gaseous matter.</li></ul></p></td>

     <td> <h2>Air polution control equipments:</h2><p style ="width:75%;height: auto;">The term "air pollution control equipment" refers to systems that stop a range of solid and gaseous pollutants from entering the atmosphere, primarily through industrial exhaust stacks (chimneys). These controls are divided into two categories: ones that limit the emissions of acidic gasses and those that limit the emissions of particulate matter.There are three primary ways that air pollution control technology can operate:

       <ol><li> Chemical Modification: In this technique, a hazardous chemical is changed into an inert chemical. Typically, flue gas desulphurization is used. Selective catalytic reduction and non-catalytic reduction methods are used to control the emissions of nitrogen oxides from stationary by converting nitrogen oxides (NOx) into molecular nitrogen (N2). Technicians may use biofiltration, thermal oxidation, or catalytic oxidation.</li>
        <li>Hazard Removal: The most prevalent and straightforward air purification method is to eliminate hazards from the air. There are numerous ways to accomplish this, but air filter systems are typically used.</li></ol>

      <td><h2>Diffusion of pollutants in air:</h2><p style ="width:75%;height:auto;">The petrochemical industry produces many air pollutants during production, such as airborne particulate matters (PM10 and PM2.5), sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, carbon oxides, etc. Petrochemical industrial accidents are more likely to cause major air pollution hazards in a short period. Therefore this study simulated diffusion and performed air pollution spatial risk analysis for potential air pollutants generated by the petrochemical industry using meteorological observation data from 2017 to 2019. The study targets were No. 6 Naphtha Cracker Complex Petrochemical Industrial Park (6NCC) of Formosa Petrochemical Corporation and Taichung Thermal Power Plant (TTPP) in central Taiwan. We used the industrial source complex model short term (ISCST3) air simulation model developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency to simulate pollutant diffusion under different weather conditions and seasons. Air pollution spatial risk was investigated for neighboring hospitals and schools for pollutant emission and diffusion to provide feedback to petrochemical related industry's risk management.

        Emission areas (6NCC and TTPP) were all in the southwest since the main air pollution accumulation and diffusion is to the northeast during monsoon season (October through March). Air pollution April through September each year is more evenly distributed, with pollutant concentrations low in all directions, approximately half the concentration in winter. Simulated air pollutant concentrations often overlapped with high risk population clusters (schools and hospitals). 6NCC posed little impact on nearby schools throughout the year; whereas TTPP posed relatively low risks to nearby schools and hospitals in summer, with slightly higher risk for Shenren Elementary School in Shengang township, Changhua County in winter. Overall 6NCC posed higher risk for Mailiao and Taixi townships in Yunlin County; whereas the TTPP posed higher risk on Longjing District of Taichung City, Shengang and Xianxi townships in Changhua County, particularly during winter. The results of this study will help the petrochemical industry and public health authority to wider manage air pollution risks.

        <td><h2>Vegetation:</h2><p><ol><li>Plants improve the air quality by absorbing the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which they use in the process of photosynthesis (formation of food with the help of sunlight).</li>
            <Li>They absorb CO2 and in turn release oxygen into the atmosphere.</Li>
            <li>They increase humidity by transpiring water vapour through stomata and they can also absorb pollutants on the external surfaces of the leaves.</li>
            <li>Thus, growing plants will help in the control of air pollution.</li></ol></p></td>

        <td><h2>Zoning:</h2><p>The zoning atlas considers only environmental aspects. The zoning atlas helps in stream-lining the decision-making process along with the following benefits:

            <ul><li>It provides a ready-reckoner for best suitable site and relevant environmental information</li>
            <li>It helps to make decisions that are simple, faster, realistic, transparent and reliable</li>
           <li> It provides a basis for incorporating environmental aspects into land use planning</li>
            <li>It helps to plan for cost effective pollution control measures and programs</li>
            <li>It helps an entrepreneur save money, time, efforts and risk</li>
            <li>Helps develop infrastructural facilities</li>
           <li> It helps check additional pollution in areas already stressed with pollution</li>
            <li>It ensures that pollution potential of an industry is compatible with local conditions</li>
            <li>It ensures that industries with high pollution potential that are desirous to locate an industry in a high risk area adopts clean technologies so that generation of wastes is prevented or made compatible with the receiving environment.</li>

            <li>Helps in creating awareness among people regarding type of industries and nature of pollution anticipated in their neighbourhood</li>
            <li>In view of all the above mentioned issues, an EIA helps achieve sustainable development.</li></ul></p>
