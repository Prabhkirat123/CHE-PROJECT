      <h2>Actived Carbon:</h2> <p style ="width: 75%;height:auto">In adsorption, gaseous pollutants are removed from an air stream by transferring the pollutants to the solid surface of an adsorbent. Activated carbon is the most commonly used adsorbent, although zeolites, polymers, and other adsorbents may be used. There is a limit to the mass of pollutants that can be collected by an adsorbent. When this limit is reached, the adsorbent is no longer effective in removing pollutant. To recover the ability to capture gaseous pollutants, adsorbents typically are "regenerated;" i.e., the pollutant is desorbed (removed) from the adsorbent. This regeneration may occur off-site or on-site.
       
        The most common types of adsorber systems use fixed beds (as opposed to fluidized beds, or the moving beds that are common in concentrator systems). One type regenerates on site; the second type, called a carbon drum, uses off-site regeneration. Carbon drum systems are low-capital-cost systems, used only when air flow rates and mass flow rates of pollutants are low. Regeneration, either on-site or off-site, typically uses either elevated temperatures (i.e., thermal desorption, sometimes using steam) or below-atmospheric pressures (vacuum regeneration). In some cases the solvent recovered from desorption (e.g., toluene from publication rotogravure printing operations) is re-introduced into the process; in other cases, it is disposed.</p></td>

     <td> <h2>Nanomaterials:</h2><p style ="width:75%;height: auto;">One of the most favorable environmental applications of nanotechnology has been in air pollution remediation in which different nanomaterials are used as nanoadsorbents, nanocatalysts, nanofilters, and nanosensors. The nanomaterials have the ability to adsorb several contaminants existing in the air. Also, certain semiconducting nanomaterials materials can be used for photocatalytic remediation. Air contamination control can also be achieved by nanostructured membranes with pores sufficiently small to separate various pollutants from the exhaust. Nanomaterial enabled sensors are also used for the detection of harmful gases such as hydrogen sulfide, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Conversely, because of the uncertainties in addition to irregularities in size, shape as well as chemical compositions, the existence of some nanomaterials might cause harmful effects on the environment along with the health of people. Thus, concerns were expressed about the transport and conversion of nanoparticles discharged into the surroundings. This review critically examined and assessed the present literature on the application of nanomaterials in the air, together with its negative impacts. The main focus is placed on the application of carbon-based and metal-based nanomaterials for air pollution remediation. It is noted that these nanomaterials demonstrating fascinating properties for improving the environmental pollution remediation system.</p></td>

      <td><h2>Biodegradable polymers:</h2><p style ="width:75%;height:auto;">Biodegradable polymers have existed since the beginning of life on the planet. All biopolymers such as polypeptides, cellulose, polysaccharides, chitin/chitosan and natural rubber are biodegradable under open atmospheric conditions. Most of the polymers obtained from biological systems and bio-based products such as vegetable oils, animal fats and extracts of plant products are biodegradable. The first man-made synthetic biodegradable polymer was poly(glycollic acid) which was invented in 1954, although it has little use in common applications. A large numbers of partially and completely biodegradable polymers and their blends are now available.2 These include poly(L-lactic acid), poly(Îµ-caprolactone), poly(3-hydroxybutarate), vegetable oil-based polyesters, epoxy and polyurethanes, in addition to naturally occurring polymers.5 The use of renewable resources in the production of polymeric materials is beneficial to the environment in three ways. First, the feedstocks employed can be replaced, either through natural cycles or through intentional human intervention. Second, the biodegradable nature of the end products prevents the pollution which would result from the disposal of the equivalent volume of conventional plastics. At the end of their useful lives, biopolymeric materials are generally sent to landfill or composted. Third, the three fold concern with the social, environmental and economic outcomes can be achieved using this technique. This book deals with the different types polymers obtained from various vegetable oils, important renewable resources, their composites and nanocomposites and their potential applications.</p>
